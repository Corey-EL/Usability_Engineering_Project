# Usability_Engineering_Project
## Project Overview
Project Overview:
- As current BGSU students, we recognize that the process of
moving in and out of dorms and apartments can really bring
attention to things you no longer need or things youâ€™d like to
have in your living space. We would like to create a venue
for BGSU students to sell or purchase items with their peers
on campus. While students could turn to other venues such
as Craigslist, our application will be exclusive to BGSU
falcons only. This may help some students feel safer and
make transactions and delivery more convenient. Our
solution can also act as an extension of the already existing
in-person event hosted by BGSU, the campus restore
program.

Problem Description:
- The problem description of what we are building is a way for
college students to sell or buy old unwanted books, furniture,
clothes, etc. We wanted to find a way for new students to
cheaply buy pre-owned items for their new college
environment. We also wanted to find a way for soon to be
graduates to sell their old and unwanted dorm/apartment
items before moving away. This would also include finding
other students to study with, hang out with, etc.

Proposed Solution:
- Our proposed solution is a software that creates a safe and
convenient way for BGSU students to sell their unwanted
items or buy items from other students on campus.
